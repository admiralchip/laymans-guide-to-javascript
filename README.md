# Layman's Guide to Javascript
A compilation of my notes on Javascript


### Definitions of words

**Expression:** Code that produces a value

**Binding:** Something that stores a value; a variable. This value can be changed. It can also be a function.

**const:** One of the keywords used to make a binding. Short form of "constant".

### Javascript Functions

They may or may not have parameters. Example of a function:

`function(x) {
  // statements
}`

where x = parameter

`Number()` : returns a value as a number
