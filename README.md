# Layman's Guide to Javascript
A compilation of my notes on Javascript


### Definitions of words

**Expression:** Code that produces a value

**Binding:** Something that stores a value. This value can be changed. It can also be a function.

**const:** One of the keywords used to make a binding. Short form of "constant". Use this when you intend that the value remains the same.

**let:** One of the keywords used to make a binding. Use this when you intend that another value will be assigned to that binding.

**Parameter:** Value passed to a function through the caller of that function (as an argument). Missing parameters are assigned the value `undefined`.

**Scope:** Refers to the visibility of a binding. 



### Javascript Functions

They may or may not have parameters. Example of a function:

```
function(x) {
  // statements
}
```

where x = parameter

`Number()` : returns a value as a number
`charAt()` : can be used to access a character in a string
